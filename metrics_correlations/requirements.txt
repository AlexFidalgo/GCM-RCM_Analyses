# NOTE: Installing the full "jupyter" meta-package can pull many packages
# that may cause Windows long-path errors during `pip install`.
# If you need a lightweight notebook kernel, install only the pieces you need,
# or install Jupyter via conda (recommended on Windows):
#   conda install -c conda-forge notebook ipykernel
# To avoid the heavy Jupyter meta-package, we include only ipykernel and notebook here.
